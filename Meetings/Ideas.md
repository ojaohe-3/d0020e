_We have discussed with the group about how to create a more clear goal of what we want to accomplish. We feel like it’s important to decide exactly what we want to do with the project. It does not matter if we go astray as long as we reach the goal we have decided for us._

### PRIO 1:

Only Teachers and System-admin will sign-in
Teachers can add KCs from existing tags
