## Summary
The group showed diagrams over the structure for the backend and how the system is going to be designed. Due to the server being down it was not possible to show a demonstration of the database and the work being done. 

Jan and Khalid asked the group to make documentation for the big picture. It should be clear how the stakeholders can take over the system and how to keep on building it. Documentation over what did not go well and what does not work as desired should also be included in the form of a “black report”. 

Regarding the stakeholders, we shall have a meeting with them again and show the current form of the system. This is to get feedback on the current state so changes can be made before the deadline of the project.  

## Action points
- Show frontend, database and diagrams over the system structure
- Document for the future
- Black report

## Next meeting
- Khalid contacts Damiano and gets back to the group with a date for the next meeting.
