## Meeting notes

At the start of the meeting Tommy was talking about our updated module diagram. It was not much to say about it. 

Wilma then continues with showing the website. First up to demonstrate is the filter container and the graphical canvas. It contains some bugs but Jan is happy that we got something to demonstrate. Jan notes that we don’t have thinked about the order for Course, program, KC and topic. 

Next up is the Teacher page, and Jan likes the design for the teacher page. 

Last up is the admin page. It is a mess but Jan doesn't think it is a problem. 

Overall for the project Jan thinks it is cool. 

Jan wants to understand the servlets. We demonstrate how the “/teacher” path is working. 

To finish the meeting Wilma shows our black-log.
