# Team Workflow
Scrum Master - Tommy Andersson
Git Master - Johan Rodahl Holmgren

For communication in the group we are using the App Telegram.

1. Startup meeting
1. Plan what to do today, arrange tasks by importance and estimate time required
1. Split into groups and assign tasks to groups
1. Decide when to have a break and present what everyone is doing and how it is going.
1. If someone has an important question, ask for everyone's attention, if not important, wait for the next break
1. At break meeting every group present what has been done
1. Split into groups and assign new tasks to groups
1. Decide when to have next break meeting and repeat 4-7
1. If no more tasks decide when to have next meeting
1. End meeting

To make decisions we vote. 
If 3-3:
Scrum Master decides
Else:
Go by vote 

If people are absent the group sends out a message on Telegram what we are about to vote for. The person/persons have one hour to vote. If they havenâ€™t voted in that time their vote is forfeit. We need to be at least four persons to vote. If scrum master is absent, appoint new temporary scrum master.

The absent people should update themselves on what has been done on the meeting before next meeting.
