## Summary
Jan starts the meeting talking about the last meeting how he chosed to be offended from all the critiques. 
He also tells the group that he wants us to tell him before we put up code on the git. 
Jesper shows how relationships works in Neo4J with his program that he did. 
Jan want instruction how to get Neo4J and how to install it and how it works. 
We will upload it on the git.

Wilma asks how we should proceed after the last meeting. Jan emailed the group pictures but they were too small 
so he writes it on the whiteboard. From what Jan wrote IDL seems like the same as KC. Teaching activity (TA) 
is activites that you do to increase your KC, it also have a description. The box containing KC, TA, 
IDL is called a course. It will be a lot of documentation but the group should prepare a structure 
like that so other people can continue on it. You can have different learning outcome (LO) from the same course. 
Courses should have an ID, name, teacher, year, incoming KC, outgoing KC, ILO with descriptions. 
This is for students to know what the students will learn from this course, it should use KC from the list. 
Program show different lists with documentation. Teaching activity (TA) should be implemented: 
TA description with two lists with KC in and KC out. 
The group asked if ILO and TA be part of the description, no objection but don’t know how to do it. 
We have to think about how to how TA and ILO should be implemetended when teachers adds new KC 
and in what order they should be listed and if ILO is made by teachers other teachers can use them. 
What you get from a course is not ILO it’s knowledge and therefore KC is more important than ILO.

An idea for the structure for ILO is: ILO→1→ string (description) list[out kc].

ILO should be connected to KC since it’s more important. Stephy talked about that ILO can can change but KC doesn’t. 
ILO also have a flaw because teachers may have a plan what students learn but doesn’t have enough time to teach it. 
TA shouldn’t be needed in the KC since that already has been covered, it’s a step between. Skills is a group of KC:s.

Jan also have an issue with how grades relates to KC. In exams teachers test how you can repeat stuff instead 
of how good you understand about it. Grades is just a digit.

We should leave room for extensions so other people can work on the project when we are done.

After the discussion about the project design the group was asked by Ulf Bodin to agree with Jan 
about the format on the stories in the report. Jan wants to see more pictures and a Gant scheme for a 
quick overview of when a task is being implemented and which task is going to be implemented in parallel. 
Also the group is asked to create an issue board on github. The issue board should work as a backlog for the 
projects with all the tasks and stories. 

Finally the group made a quick demonstration of the UML diagram. Jan asked some questions about the arrows and 
suggested us to take a look and change them to make them more readable. 


## Action points
- Publish instructions for how to use Neo4j Desktop on git
- Finish sprint planning
- Prepare the design for implementation of Intended learning outcomes and Teacher Activity
