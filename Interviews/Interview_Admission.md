# Summary Interview with Åsa and Eva at Admission
As of today the people working with admission use the course plans to decide if students are eligible. If the new system presented was the same for all universities it would help a lot. Instead of looking at course plans for all other universities the knowledge components could be used as a reference to see if students are eligible. This would help because many students do not follow their course plan instead they need to make their own. 

At Luleå University of Technology program students are not sharply reviewed when applying for a course. To be eligible to an advanced course students needs 90 credits (hp) and must show progression in the program. The interviewees don’t know how other universities handle this. 

In Sweden we have the same system for admission for all universities in the country, which makes it, somewhat, easy to view eligibility of students from other universities.
