I am Marcus Eriksson third year student at civil enjineering in computer science, as I am writing this I am 25 years old 
I live with a wonderful puppy named Klara, before I went to LTU I studied at a people high academy in Haparanda
In my free time I enjoy scuba diving, but not so much anymore since I am spending time studying and I have a lot to do
in my free time so I need to make sure those things gets done but most importantly that Klara is feed,played with and taken out
on her walks she needs.
